<h2>Website 1 Critique - Jami Lin</h2>
<h4><a href="https://jamilin.com/">www.jamilin.com</a></h4>
<ol>
	<li>My first impression of this website is that it is vibrant and outdated.</li>
	<li>The website includes links of different websites rather than individual pages.</li>
	<li>The structure of the site is very confusing as the flow of content does not differentiate layouts, it only uses a vertical layout.</li>
	<li>The site's graphics and layout is distracting as it has a mixed color scheme and utilizes an outdated design of graphics.</li>
	<li>The load time was reasonable, it loaded within 3 seconds.</li>
	<li>The text color and size is readable. Since the site's images had no background included, it did not detract it.</li>
	<li>The site did not include a navigation bar, it only had a home page.</li> 
	<li>The color scheme was not coherent throughout the other pages and links on the site.</li>
	<li>The website was not responsive as different pages on the site did not interact with a smaller window.</li>
	<li>The website approach was unusual as it's design is very outdated.</li>
